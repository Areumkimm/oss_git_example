### _Markdown_

Markdown is a lightweight markup language that you can use to add formatting elements to plaintext documents. It is widely used in README files, documentation, and writing posts for web platforms.

- **Italic**: Use asterisks or underscores.
- **Bold**: Use double asterisks or underscores.
- **Headers**: Use hashtags for different levels.
- **Lists**: Ordered and unordered lists are easy to create.
  - Example:
    1. First item
    2. Second item
    3. Third item
  - Unordered list:
    * Item 1
    * Item 2
    * Item 3
